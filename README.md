# Orca Slicer Backup & Restore Utility

This project contains executables and the scripts they were created with to backup and restore Orca Slicer configurations. These are your custom created filaments, printer setup and process configuration. This software is programmed for Windows and I may add offical Linux support later on.

## How to use?

If you can use Orca Slicer, you can use these tools.
I have turned these scripts into executables for maximum accessability. You can also of course run the Python scripts if you do not want to use the executables.

## Troubleshooting

Pull requests and posting issues are highly appreciated! Please post your potential improvements! Thank you!
